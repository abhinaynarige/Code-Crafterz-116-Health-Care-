Delayed diagnosis of diseases like cancer,  diabetes, or heart ailments increases treatment costs and reduces survival rates. So we have created a website  based on Risk Prediction.

🩺 EarlyCare — AI-Assisted Preventive Healthcare Platform
"Predict, Prevent, Protect" — Empowering early disease detection and faster medical response.

📖 Project Overview
EarlyCare is an intelligent healthcare platform designed to assist in early diagnosis of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular ailments.
It aims to reduce diagnostic delays, increase survival rates, and cut treatment costs by enabling early detection and fast doctor-patient interaction.

The system provides:

🏠 Patient Portal with a chatbot symptom checker
📅 Appointment Booking System
👨‍⚕️ Doctor Dashboard for appointment management and patient insights
🚀 Key Features
💬 Symptom Checker | Predicts possible diseases using chatbot logic. 📈 Health Dashboard | Visual graphs for disease risk and awareness. 📅 Appointment Booking | Patients can schedule appointments easily. 👨‍⚕️ Doctor Dashboard | Doctors can view appointments and mark them as completed. 💾 Local Backend Simulation | Uses localStorage as a backend for offline demos. 🔒 Doctor Login | Secure access for authorized medical staff.

🧠 Expected Outcomes
✅ A prototype that supports early and accurate disease prediction
⚡ Reduced diagnostic delays, improving medical response time
🧩 Decision support tools for doctors
🏥 Scalable design for future integration with hospital systems
💰 Cost reduction through preventive diagnosis
📊 Measurable Indicators
Diagnostic Accuracy | Model prediction accuracy | 92–99% | Sensitivity (TPR) | Correctly identified positive cases | >90% | Specificity (TNR) | Correctly identified negative cases | >93% | Reduced Misdiagnosis | Fewer false negatives | ✅ | Doctor Efficiency | Time saved per consultation | 30–40% |
